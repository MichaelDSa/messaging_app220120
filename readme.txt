I began this project to practice coding web apps, and apply my understanding of programming over the long term.

This messaging app:
 > is account based. 
  > The user must have an account and log in to use it.
  > The user can only message other users.
 > can send messages to multiple recipients.
 > indicates when a new message has been detected.
 > can delete a conversation from the user's account (but not from participant's account)
 > has a settings page on which the user's password can be changed.

This code:
 > Does not use a php or JS framework
 > Uses the Bulma CSS framework 

Possible next steps:
 > Convert code to OOP
 > Apply my own CSS stylesheet rather than use Bulma.
 > Learn and use sockets instead of Fetch API to display and detect new messages.
 > add notification sounds that can be turned on/off.
 > allow emojis in messages
 > allow images in messages
 > detect hyperlinks in messages
 > limit multiple log-ins of users.
 > Other settings, such as user profiles, set user icon, account deletion.
