p220314-1621 real-time updating
I am reasearching how to update my messaging web app in real-time.
QUESTIONS: 
 > if the app updates in real-time using AJAX, which is client-side JS, is it secure? Can people see the code? Does it provide access to the database?
 > Is it better to use websockets to send database updates to the client-side AJAX?
