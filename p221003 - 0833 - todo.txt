CODE FOR THE APP BELONGS IN: C:\Users\dsa21\OneDrive\Desktop\zettelkasten\Literature Notes\AAA Programming\Code Bank - My experiments\PHP 220120

GOAL: to clean up chat_app220120 so that I can use it as a project item in my resume. The project goal is a proof of concept product.

*WHAT TO DO/CLEAN UP:

I) CHANGE FILE NAME:
> I don't like the file name, 'Chat_app220120'


II) CHANGE DATABASE NAME:
> The database name is 'Chat_app220120'. I want to change the databse name.
 > is it possible?
  > I could try:
   > 1) duplicating the database with a different name.
   > 2) reimplementing a new database with the old MySQL code, but with a new name.
   > 3) a new approach without using the MySQL command-line application:
       > use php code that will check if the database exists. if it does not exit, create the database, otherwise do nothing.

> files that contain chat_app220120 as a database name:
 > Instead of manually searching for 'chat_app220120' on each line, just use VScode to find and replace globally. BUT FIRST: 1) make initial commit. 2) solve the MySQL problem.
IGNORE > mysqli_connect_first.php
IGNORE  > lines commented out: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15 
IGNORE  > lines not commented out: 18
IGNORE > mysqli_connect_second.php


III) DELETE UNECESSARY FILES:

IV) CREATE GITHUB REPO

V) ADD TO HIROKU

DONE 1) learn how to treat a separate folder as a repo
DONE 2) copy the messaging app to the app folder
DONE 3) initialize a git folder in the app folder
DONE 4) remotely create a repo in /MAMP
DONE 5) push the working directory to Mamp repo.
 > What was done: 
   i) Cloned the original directory to a folder in MAMP.
   ii) this clone can only do one thing in Git: $ git pull.
      > The origin folder cannot push!
      > all editing, committing & other git work to be done in origin folder. Clone is pull only - for the sake of being read by MAMP.
	  
6) push the working directory to GitHub repo.

7) either create a new database, or rename the current database.
  > Test: create a database in the PHP MyAdmin gui, then try cloning that database with a different name.
7a) consider some code that: 
   > 1. exports all data from db, 2. deletes all data from db on shutdown. 3. imports all data on startup.
    > All MySQL import files can be version controled with Git. The MySQL server just functions as a server without storing the data.
8) rename the chat_app file
9) in VS Studio Code, find "chat_app" and replace globally on each page.


--------------vvv IDEAS vvv--------------

- Rename database
 > But there are erroneous enteries, so I'd rather have a new db.

- Duplicate database
 > Probably not possible for security reasons.

- Create new database
 > Ultimately this may be the only & best solution

- choose different name for filename and database
 > separate names will be less confusing.
